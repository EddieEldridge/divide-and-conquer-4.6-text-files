-- Refusal will gain you the support of the Elves of Lindon in the form of their maritime expertise, plus the elite 'Azaghal's Tomb Protectors' unit.
-- Accepting the offer will set you on to a road with conflict with the other peoples of Eriador, and possibly even the other Dwarves, as the Dwarves slowly become consumed with greed and paranoia. But you will get the support of the emergant "Grimborn" Dwarves in the form of the powerful 'Grimborn Reavers' unit
and a unique General with this unit as his bodyguard. It will also allow you to pursue the "Reclaiming Dwarven Relics" event for rewards of gold and unique Ancillary items.
-- The AI has a 50-50 chance to make either decision. But attacks on their homelands will not happen for the AI.

- New Event Script: "Reclaiming Dwarven Relics"
-- Optional. Up to the player to pursue it
-- Requires accepting the rings
-- After getting the rings, their power slowly starts increasing the greed in the dwarves. The clans of old Belegost and Nogrod kingdoms are rising in power. After thousands of years of failing to restore the old splendour of their now ruined cities, getting no help from other dwarven clans, the arrival of Erebor refugees (mainly Longbeards) who made new home in Thorins Halls only increased resentment towards them.
But now, with the arrival of Grinfarn and his followers, the Firebeards and Broadbeams are seizing back the power. The rings are driving them forward to remake the riches and fame of old ruined Kingdoms. Even though it has been over six thousand years, some Belegost or Nogrod made dwarven relics of first age still exist today and Dwarves of Ered Luin want them back in their possession.
-- Send a diplomat to the Dunedain and their leader Aragorn, who reside in Fennas Drunin and demand the broken sword Narsil (made by dwarven smith Telchar in the First Age), and to Rohan where we should demand the return of the silver Horn of the Mark currently owned by Theoden (made by descendant of dwarven smiths of Belegost in the grey mountains, later stolen by Scatha the dragon and after its death, by Fram). Should the Dunedain and the Rohirrim deny our request, we should take them by force.
-- When Aragorn and Theoden die (how it comes to that is up to the player) send a spy to Imladris, where Aragorn will be buried, to steal the Narsil pieces, and to Edoras where Theoden will be buried and steal the horn.
-- Dwarves also look to the west, were in the sea lie western isles. On the Isle of Tol Morwen lays the grave of Turin and within it buried the great Dragon-helm of Dor-lómin (made by dwarven smith Telchar in the First Age). Hire a ship and send a spy to the isle of Tol Morwen to excavate the helm and bring it back to Blue mountains


(Bonus) Ar-Adunaim
- Almost all Ar-Adunaim units now have a new appearance. **Credit to 'Theodron' of the Blood of Numenor mod's Numenor and Kingdom of Belegaer units**

- Guard of the Caves now have throwing axes

- New Event Script: "Theoden"
-- King Theoden starts the game locked in Edoras (technically he can move 1 tile per turn because of the roads mp bonus, but better to leave him where he is), simulating him being deceived by Grima, thus somewhat falling under the Sarumans influence. While Theoden is deceived he has a big negative effect trait. 
-- On the 9th turn, when Gandalf arrives to "cure" Theoden, the deceived trait is removed and Theoden gets a positive trait and a new epithet, and on the 10th turn King Theoden is free to move again.


Other Event Scripts
- Dwarven Grudges
-- Optional. Up to the player to pursue it
-- This is a script for Erebor and Khazad Dum factions. It deals with reclaiming lost dwarven cities back to dwarven rule. Settlements of Gundabad, Dain's Halls, West and East Khazad-Dum (and Erebor were it to be conquered by non dwarven faction during your campaign) need to be owned by any dwarven faction (including Ered Luin) for it to be "completed".
On the first successful completion of the objective, player is rewarded money reward (if in the future any of the cities are lost and again reconquered, money isn't rewarded). When any of mentioned cities is not under dwarven ownership, Erebor and Khazad Dum faction leaders get a trait which slightly increases unrest. When all of the mentioned cities are owned by dwarven factions, Erebor and Khazad Dum faction leaders gain trait which provides various good effects.

- Rhun Dragon Relic Hunt
-- Optional. Up to the player to pursue it
-- This is a script for Rhun faction. Dragon Cult is gaining power among the easterlings and they want to increase their power and influence among the clans. The seek to acquire dragon related items to bolster their influence and bring more followers to their worship. Parts of Scatha's Hoard remain in the Vale of Anduin and a diplomat should be sent to Beorn's Halls to try and acquire some of these treasures, as dragons magic still lingers in the gold they touched.
In the north where kingdom of Dale is located, the remains of Smaug are located in the Long lake. Send a diplomat to Esgaroth (Lake Town) to try and acquire some of the remains of Smaug and the jewels that were encrusted onto his scales. Or you can send an army and conquer Beorn's Halls and Esgaroth to gain the relics.
Send a spy to Withered Heath to try and acquire a Dragon Egg, since the regions is well known to have been a breeding ground for dragons in the past. Faction leader gets a trait that tracks how many relics you have obtained, giving various effects with increasing levels. After getting scatha's atrefact, Rhun gets unique heir ancillary Scatha's Hoard. After acquiring smaugs artefact/jewels, faction leader or heir (depends who has ancillary space) gets a special Dragon Artefact Helm Ancillary. After getting all of the relics the script is complete and player is rewarded money.

- Dunland Grudge
-- Optional. Up to the player to pursue it
-- This is a short script for Dunland. As Dunland you bare a grudge against the rohirrim, who have taken your lands in the Westfold and driven you north to the mountains. In the past King Wulf has captured Edoras and proclaimed himself King of Dunland and Rohan, but he was defeated. Dunland faction leader gets trait which has s slight unrest debuff while Edoras is not owned by Dunland. If you conquer Edoras you get money reward and faction leader gets a positive trait. Once Edoras is conquered any subsequent dunland faction leaders will have a trait, which can go negative if you lose Edoras again.

- Denethor
-- This is a script for Gondor. It simulates Denethor's descending "madness", result of year sand years of using Palantir and mind battling Sauron. The script takes 110 turns to reach final stage, but it can be quickened by various things: Losing a lot of battles, Losing Eastern Osgiliath to Mordor, Faramir and/or Boromir dying. Denethor gets Anor Stone ancillary and a trait line that tracks his progression in the madness. As the game progresses there are many events that pop up and progress it to next stage. It starts beneficial with first few levels giving positive effects.
-- After a certain point, the effects turn into increasingly negative, the worse Denethors state becomes. In the last two stages of the script, all gondorian generals get a trait with slight negative effects. (with so many positive effects around it wont be a major difference). Denethor can be redeemed and lose the mandess trait by either destroying the ring, or capturing all of Mordor's provinces (so destryoing Mordor as a faction in both cases) and a player is rewarded with some money. Script ends if Denethor dies and any negative or positive effects are removed.


General
- "Shattered Alliances" Alternate Campaign.
-- This is essentially the "Total War" submod but now bundled with DaC by default and accessed via the Alternate Campaign menu option on the main menu
-- As before this removes all starting wars and alliances that the campaign would normally begin within
-- In addition it cancels all event scripts that would force the player to ally or go to war with other factions. Such as those for Khand, Ered Luin, Lothlorien and Woodland Realm. You'll instead be able to build any buildings or units associated with those scripts imediately.

- "Relentless": Certain units can no longer have their own attacks interrupted by incoming enemy attacks  **Credit to Jojo00182 for the animation tweaks needed to make this work**

Traits
- removed or reworked all existing vanilla traits
- Chivalry system reworked - Negative chivalry aka Dread is now used by a few specific generals - Sauron, Nazguls, King of the Dead, Saruman. Positive Chivalry is renamed to Renown and is now used by all other generals.
  "Good" factions (Elves, Dwarves, ND, Dol Amroth, Gondor, Northmen, Enedwaith) generals gain "good" Renown trait by killing orcish prisoners, exterminating/sacking orcish settlements, occupying non orcish settlements, ransoming or releasing non orcish prisoners, paying ransom for your own prisoners, generals fighting in battle and getting kills, being a good governor (not having people rebel or riot). You can lose renown if you execute non orcish prisoners, exterminate non orcish settlements (rebel settlements dont count), refuse to ransom your captives if you have certain amount of money, generals not fighting in battle and losing it
  "Evil" factions (Orcs, Rhun, Harad, AA, Dunland, Angmar, Khand - even if you go good path) gain "bad" Renown trait in same, but opposite way as the good factions -Orcs gain it by exterminating settlements, executing prisoners, general unit fighting in battle etc, while non orcs gain it for extermination and executing orcish towns/prisoners also.
- Piety was renamed Acumen, and it now serves as an attribute and base for acquiring better management/governance/economy traits. It increases income of the settlements slightly and helps fighting corruption.
- Brand new tooltips for 'Command' 
- Brand new tooltips and UI symbols for 'Acumen' and 'Renown'
- Supply system: Every major race gets its own supply trait line and it differs slightly how fast it depletes or replenishes. General starts with max supply and it replenishes very fast in friendly provinces/settlements. It gets depleted while in enemy provinces or when being besieged. Having max supply gives you some battlesurgery effect, while having less than max will give you slight morale hit and movement points reduction (to simulate army foraging for supplies). It wont have major effect on the gameplay, but it is there for extra immersion.
- Many provinces have a negative debuffs for certain factions when in that province:
  > Lorien gives big negative effect (especially for orcs) to non elven factions while owned by Lothlorien
  > Mirkwood gives debuff except for Elven factions, Vale of ANduin and Dol Guldur.
  > Southeren Arid/hot zones of Harad give Arid Climate debuff to all factions except Ar Adunaim, Harad, Rhun and Khand, while Harad and Khand also get bonus while in these provinces
  > Northeren cold provinces give Cold Climate debuff to all factions except Dwarves, Gundabad and Angmar, while Angmar and Gundabad also get a bonus while in those provinces
  > Mordor (proper) provinces give Ash Climate debuff for all non orcish factions, while orcs gain buff while in those provinces
